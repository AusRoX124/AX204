	<h1>Intro (really long :)</h1>
	<p>Heller, me nam is astain. I em ae spewing phailer. JK LOL! I'm good at English. My name is Austin and I live in Hong Kong, SAR, China. The weather here is only good in the summer and winter. Unless you like wind and humidity. I like history and science. When it comes to science I really like energy and stuff. Me and my friend Michael like to make theoritcal inventions, like hypersonic orbital bombers and carbon recyclers. When it come to history, I love to talk about the 20th century wars, more specifically world war 2. I know all about the weapons and battles. I have 2 little brothers, James, at 9, and Gabe, at 6. Myself? I'm 12. I want to work at NASA, as a chemist or astrophysist. Not sure if I spelt that correctly :). I LOVE to play video games. Especially war games, like World of Tanks, War Thunder, Halo, and Verdun. But I'm not a warmonger, I also play civ 5, the esapists, among others. Other than game, I spend my free time watching Kerbel Space Program, mostly KSP super colonization with Toxic Time Waster. I also love to eat. Gabe eats to love, and I live to eat! James is in the middle. I don't have any pets, but my mom does. She has 2 boxers named Sarafina and Toby. We used to have 2 baby turtles, but both died, one even last night! X:::::::( (crying face). I don't do sports, I'm a couch potatoe. I sometimes get deppressed about my personal issues, but it only lasts like a couple hours, so don't worry. Thats all for now, maybe I'll talk more later. See ya, as TTW always said.</p>
